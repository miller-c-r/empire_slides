    "text": "Inception of Negro Regiments and Cavalry\nOn July 28, 1866, the United States Congress passed legislation to establish two cavalry (9th and 10th) and four infantry regiments, (38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st) to be made up of African American enlisted men. (2) Three years later in 1869, the four infantry regiments were consolidated into two regiments, the 24th and 25th Infantry. The troops were paid thirteen dollars a month, plus room, board and clothing. Enlistment was for five years. Almost immediately these new regiments were transferred to the western states and territories for service on the American frontier."
