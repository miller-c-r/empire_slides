## Inception of Negro Regiments and Cavalry

National Archives:

On July 28, 1866, the United States Congress passed legislation to establish two cavalry (**9th** and **10th**) and four infantry regiments,

(**38th**, **39th**, **40th,** and **41st**) to be made up of African American enlisted men.

Three years later in 1869, the four infantry regiments were consolidated into two regiments, the **24th** and **25th** Infantry.

## Inception of Negro Regiments and Cavalry

The troops were paid thirteen dollars a month, plus room, board and clothing. Enlistment was for five years.

Almost immediately these new regiments were transferred to the western states and territories for service on the American frontier.

## The End of the Spanish American War

Following the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish American War in December of 1898, the United States took control of the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.

Companies from the segregated Black infantry regiments reported to the Presidio of San Francisco on their way to the Philippines in early 1899.
