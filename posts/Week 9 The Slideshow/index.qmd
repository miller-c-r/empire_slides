## Inception of Negro Regiments and Cavalry

National Archives:

On July 28, 1866, the United States Congress passed legislation to establish two cavalry (**9th** and **10th**) and four infantry regiments,

(**38th**, **39th**, **40th,** and **41st**) to be made up of African American enlisted men.

Three years later in 1869, the four infantry regiments were consolidated into two regiments, the **24th** and **25th** Infantry.

## Inception of Negro Regiments and Cavalry

The troops were paid thirteen dollars a month, plus room, board and clothing. Enlistment was for five years.

Almost immediately these new regiments were transferred to the western states and territories for service on the American frontier.

## The Treaty of Paris & End of the Spanish American War

The Spanish American War ended in the late 19th century, 1898. The United States then acquired: Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Phillippines.

The U.S. was not able to hold the Phillipines and so, in 1899 there was deployment of African American soldiers from segregated Black infantry regiments.

## The Treaty of Paris & End of the Spanish American War

They were based out of the Presidio of San Francisco and used for this imperialistic effort to subjugate a foreign non-white populace

## The Negro has no Flag to Defend

African Americans, now free are still navigating what it means to exist in America as black people. Free does not mean equal and so in Reconstruction era south they face opposition to holding full rights bestowed upon the white majority with limitations on their personal freedoms.

## The Negro has no Flag to Defend

At the hands of "white riff raff" African Americans are murdered and face acts of violence, particularly lynching as other white citizens continue in silence. This sentiment is echoed by Ida. B. Wells-Barnett

## Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mob Violence

African Americans were not just facing acts of violence amidst reconstruction in the south but also the northern states.

Before the United States military looked to its imperialistic aspirations it should first see to enforcing the rights and protections for all of its citizens

## The Morality of the War and the Negro Soldier

Discouraging enlistment was intertwined with the gospel of the church. Comparing it to a member of the church indulging in liquor, thievery, brothels, breaking the sabbath

## The Cuban Man in the Jim Crow Train Car

There is an anecdote of a man in Cuba's interactions with white Americans and white American racism. Under threat of violence he is relegated to a Jim Crow train car as he traveled.

What is significant is the small detail that he was not black, perhaps indicating that he was a person of color? Or simply due to his not being an ethnicity acceptable to the White Americans.

## The Value of African American Lives

Lastly it was asked of African Americans to consider how precious their only life is.

That enlisting in America's military would be throwing their lives away.

"If you have a spare life on hand, throw it away for a better purpose,"
